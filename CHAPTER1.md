Domain Experts

effective design

Effective design meets the needs of the business organization to the extent that it can distinguish itself from its competition by means of software

guide the creation of the correct software model

## Strategic Design

broad brushstrokes

segregate domain models using Bounded Contexts

develop a Ubiquitous Language as your domain model within an explicitly Bounded Context

Subdomains

integrate multiple Bounded Contexts using a technique called Context Mapping

Context Maps define both team relationships and technical mechanisms that exist between two integrating Bounded Contexts

## Tactical Design

thin brush to paint the fine details

Aggregate pattern - aggregate entities and value objects together into a right-sized cluster

Domain Events

interested parties might be your own local Bounded Context and other remote Bounded Context
